# low-disc

A Clojure library of [low discrepancy
sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence) algorithms.

The following algorithms are implemented:

* Van der Corput sequence (scrambled and unscrambled)
* Halton sequence (scrambled and unscrambled)

## Usage

### Van der Corput Sequence

```Clojure
(take 4 (low-disc.vdc/vdc 2))         ;;=> (1/2 1/4 3/4 1/8)
```

### Halton Sequence

```Clojure
(take 4 (low-disc.halton/halton-2d))  ;;=> ([1/2 2/3] [1/4 1/3] [3/4 2/9] [1/8 8/9])
```
